# ================

# Main graph execution class. Current execution method is simple:
# 1. topologically sort nodes
# 2. prepare execution node for each node and connects them by outlets
# 3. execute in the topological order and set result to the execution node
#    â€“ result is used as input for other nodes

# TODO: allow use of lists of objects, such as rows[] or sql[]. Currently
# there is no way how to specify this kind of connections in the graph.

# ExecutionSteps and consumption is a dictionary mapping a node to number of
